Velô Toulouse 
=============

Hi everyone,

this is a conceptual angular and polymer app for the location service of bicycle in Toulouse.
This is like my sandbox project for AngularJS and Material Design.

It allows you to :
- Find any Vélô station in the city
- Get informations avout it (remaining bicyle and stands, distance from your localisation)
- Add stations to your favorites and manage them

Feel free to give any feedback or idea about the project, I'd love to push it further !


Update
=============

- Replaced gmap with leaflet.js and opensource project OpenStreetMap
- Added marker clustering


Things to do 
=============

- Add map path from localisation to any station
- Add alert system for number of remaining bicycle or stands.
- Fix the issue about the focused element on mobile button touch 
- Customise OpenStreetMap
- Make a generic version of the app which can be used for any city of the JCDecaux contracts
- Replace Css with LESS and allow simple theming with color var.
- Make a phonegap (or ionic ?) version of the app
