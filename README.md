Velô Toulouse 
=============

Hi everyone,

this is a conceptual angular and polymer app for the location service of bicycle in Toulouse.
This is like my sandbox project for AngularJS and Material Design.

<img src="http://simonbats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/main1.jpg" alt="Velo-toulouse app showcase"/>

It allows you to :
- Find any Vélô station in the city
- Get informations avout it (remaining bicyle and stands, distance from your localisation)
- Add stations to your favorites and manage them

You can try it on my website :

Feel free to give any feedback or idea about the project, I'd love to push it further !


Update
=============

- Replaced gmap with leaflet.js and opensource project OpenStreetMap
- Added marker clustering
- Made a generic version of the app which can be used for any city of the JCDecaux contracts and fire an alert if the cit is not in the JCDecaux databse


Things to do 
=============

- Customise OpenStreetMap
- Replace Css with LESS and allow simple theming with color var
- Optimise animations on mobile devices
- Add map path from localisation to any station
- Add alert system for number of remaining bicycle or stands
- Make a phonegap (or ionic ?) version of the app
